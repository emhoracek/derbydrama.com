## Tools and Materials

* A place to communicate such as Discord, Google Hangouts, Zoom, Streamyard, or similar. You can use voice, video, or even text chat.
* A dice roller. You can use a tool like Roll20, rollforyour.party, rolldicewithfriends.com, rolz.org, or a plug-in for Discord. Or let folks use their own meatspace dice (but then you don’t have the fun of seeing everyone’s results right away…)
* A copy of the [Derby Drama playsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pq7FdCBCoKnS-jZ83ASHcAyv6eG2xlrHZXSYC8gDoug/edit). To make a copy:
    * Log in to Google Drive, then click on the link to the playsheet above.
    * Go to “File” then “Make a copy”.
    * Click “Share” in the upper right, then “Get shareable link”.
    * Click on the down arrow where it says “Anyone with the link can view” and change it to “Anyone with the link can edit”.
    * Copy that link and share it with the players.

## Safety Tools
The rule book includes instructions for the “X-Card” and “Official Time-out” safety tools and you can still use those online. Instead of using a physical card, you can type in chat or say “X that” out loud. Offer methods for players to reach you personally such as direct message or private chat and make sure to watch for messages during the game, because players may be wary of speaking up in front of other players. In this way, playing online is actually nicer than playing at a table, where it’s harder to communicate privately!

## Tips for online facilitation

### Avoiding awkward pauses and helping quiet players
Avoid asking “Does anybody want to X?” or “Does anyone have ideas for Y?”. Many people have a hard time telling when they can/should talk in a group online, so that leads to a lot of awkward pauses. Instead try to ask specific players or characters. “Cassie, do you have an idea for X?” or “Kevin, what does Shmup Noodle do in between jams?”

### Sharing the spotlight

If you want to be careful not to pick on the same players every time, keep track of who you are asking first each section of the game and rotate. For example, say the players in order in Discord voice chat are:
* You
* Amber
* Kirby
* Mallory

Write the names in that order on a piece of paper.

The first time, ask “Amber, do you have an idea for setting?” then go around and also ask Kirby and Mallory if they don’t just jump in. Put a dot next to Amber’s name so you know that you asked her this time. Then next time, you would say, “Kirby, do you have an idea for you and Mallory’s team name?” And the time after that, you would ask, “Mallory, what is your character’s derby name?” So now on your paper you have:
* Amber (*)
* Kirby (*)
* Mallory (*)

And you can start again from the top!
