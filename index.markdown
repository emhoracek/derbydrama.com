Derby Drama: The Bout
======================

<cite>The Bout</cite> is a tabletop role-playing game about the drama and
excitement of skating in a roller derby match. Each player
takes on the character of a skater in the bout and acts out
both athletic competition and interpersonal conflict.

During <cite>The Bout</cite>, two teams play a series of rounds
known as <strong>jams</strong>. In each jam, one <strong>jammer</strong>
from each team attempts to score points by passing members
of the other team. At the same time, <strong>blockers</strong>
try to prevent the opposing jammer from passing
members of their own team. The team with the most points wins
the bout -- but at what cost? You will decide! Between jams,
players can use HEART to encourage their own team or DRAMA to
undermine their opponents.

This game is not intended to be a realistic simulation of a
roller derby bout. Instead it’s intended to give the *feeling*
of playing derby, with the drama and chaos dialed up to 11.
You don’t need to be familiar with derby to enjoy or “win”
<cite>The Bout</cite> (and hopefully losing is just as fun!)

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

<h3>Q: Do I have to know about role-playing to play <cite>The Bout</cite>?</h3>

A: Nope! <cite>Derby Drama: The Bout</cite> is designed be easy to learn for
both new and experienced role-players.

<h3>Q: Do I have to know about roller derby to play <cite>The Bout</cite>?</h3>

A: Nope! First, <cite>The Bout</cite> is sports drama, and in any sports drama
the sport itself is secondary to the relationships and conflicts
between characters. Plus, the book has plenty reference images and information
to help new players easily fake some roller derby expertise.

<h3>Q: How many players can play?</h3>

A: <cite>The Bout</cite> works best with two evenly divided teams of 1-3 players
on each team. It can also work with uneven numbers of players
with a bit of effort.

<h3>Q: How long does the game take?</h3>

A: <cite>The Bout</cite> takes two to three hours to play. Games with fewer players
will be shorter than a six player game. To shorten a game, you
could try using a timer to add time pressure to the jams. (I have not tested this and I'm
not sure it would be fun.)

<h3>Q: "Tabletop role-playing" - so like <cite>Dungeons & Dragons?</cite></h3>

A: Yeah! *and* no! Like D&D, you and your friends take on
 fictional personas and tell a story together. Like D&D, you
 roll dice to decide what happens. Like D&D, it's super fun!

 But in other ways The Bout is really different. For one, <cite>The Bout</cite>
 doesn't have a "Dungeon Master" (a single player who is responsible for the setting,
 enemies, and non-player characters). Instead, the players are
 all equally responsible for telling the story. <cite>The Bout</cite> is much simpler,
 and it's intended for one-shots instead of a long series of connected games. And
 <cite>The Bout</cite> uses only common six-sided dice, instead of D&D's several differently-sized
 dice.

 If you like D&D, you may (or may not!) like The Bout! If you hate D&D,
 still consider giving <cite>The Bout</cite> a try.

<h3>Q: If <cite>The Bout</cite> isn't like D&D, what is it like?</h3>

I was inspired by several games while making this, including:
  * Avery Adler's [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year) (contempt tokens!)
  * Grant Howitt's [Crash Pandas](https://gshowitt.itch.io/crash-pandas) (blind-bidding chaos)
  * Luke Crane's [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/) (binary dice pools)
  * Epidiah Ravachol's [Swords Without Master](https://www.worldswithoutmaster.com/swords-without-master) (reading instructions while playing)
  * Sage LaTorra & Adam Koebel's [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/)
  * Lucian Kahn's [Visigoths vs Mall Goths](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/luciankahn/visigoths-vs-mall-goths)
  * John Harper's [Lasers & Feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/)

...buuuuut I don't think <cite>The Bout</cite> is much like any of them! I <em>hope</em>
that it's exactly like a roller derby bout squished into a book and character sheets
and some dice!

<h3>Q: Okay, but seriously, how do you play?</h3>

The full ruleset isn't ready yet, but here's a summary:

Each player choses to play a Jammer or a Blocker. They create a derby name
and look for their character, as well as assigning numbers to four
stats: OFFENSE, DEFENSE, DRAMA, and HEART.

Just like a real roller derby bout, <cite>The Bout</cite> is broken up
into two periods, each having multiple jams.

During a jam, players decide (secretly) on a specific strategy or play. Then, each team
rolls the Team Dice that determine the score. Next, each player reveals
their strategy. A good offensive strategy can allow your own team to
re-roll a low score to gain more points. A
good defensive strategy can force the opposing team to re-roll a high
score. A failed strategy can lead to a penalty -- making scoring in the
next jam all the more difficult.

When all the players have played out their strategies, the Team Dice
totals are added to the Scoreboard. The team with the highest score
at the end of the bout will win the game-within-the-game.

Between jams and at halftime, players can role-play how they are
feeling about the bout, their teammates, and their rivals. They can try
to gain advantage for their own team by Boosting Morale (with HEART), or
disadvantage the opposing team by Stirring Up DRAMA. Friendship,
romance, revenge, and straight-up cheating are all on the table. However -
schemes can backfire. If your team has Too Much Drama, everything
spirals out of control, and who knows what could happen?

Hopefully this summary gets you excited to see the full rules and
try out the game!

The Future
----------------------
<cite>Derby Drama: The Bout</cite> will be released someday soonish
as a 32-page zine, complete with rules, a facilitation guide, and a
premade setting (a small-town co-ed roller derby league). I'll
also release a spreadsheet for online play and printable character
sheets for offline play.

Eventually I hope to expand the game to allow ongoing campaigns about
the trials and travails of running a non-profit roller derby league,
including training, committees, and balancing family, work, and roller derby.
This will be a sort of higher-level resource-management and
diplomacy game -- can you find a practice space? can you recruit and
train new skaters? can you retain your veterans? what happens when
the star jammer gets pregnant? when your biggest sponsor drops the
league? Can your league even survive to play the next bout?

That game is going to happen -- someday. First, I want to make
<cite>The Bout</cite> the most fun game it can be!
