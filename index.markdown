<cite>Derby Drama</cite> is a tabletop role-playing
game about the drama and excitement of skating in a roller derby match. Each player
takes on the character of a skater in the bout and acts out
both athletic competition and interpersonal conflict.

During <cite>Derby Drama</cite>, two teams play a series of rounds
known as <strong>jams</strong>. In each jam, one <strong>jammer</strong>
from each team attempts to score points by passing members
of the other team. At the same time, <strong>blockers</strong>
try to prevent the opposing jammer from passing
members of their own team. The team with the most points wins
the bout -- but at what cost? You will decide!

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

<h3>Q: Do I have to know about role-playing to play?</h3>

A: Nope! <cite>Derby Drama</cite> is designed be easy to learn for
both new and experienced role-players.

<h3>Q: Do I have to know about roller derby to play?</h3>

A: Nope! The book has plenty reference images and information
to help new players easily fake some roller derby expertise.

<h3>Q: How many players can play?</h3>

A: <cite>Derby Drama</cite> works best with two evenly divided teams of 1-3 players
on each team. It can also work with uneven numbers of players
with a bit of effort.

<h3>Q: How long does the game take?</h3>

A: Just like real roller derby, <cite>Derby Drama</cite> is divided up into
phases called "jams". It takes two to four hours to play if you
play three jams in each half of the game. To shorten a game, just play fewer jams!

<h3>Q: "Tabletop role-playing" - so like <cite>Dungeons & Dragons?</cite></h3>

A: Yeah! *and* no! Like D&D, you and your friends take on
 fictional personas and tell a story together. Like D&D, you
 roll dice to decide what happens. Like D&D, it's super fun!

 But in other ways this game is really different. For one, <cite>Derby Drama</cite>
 doesn't have a "Dungeon Master" (a single player who is responsible for the setting,
 enemies, and non-player characters). Instead, the players are
 all equally responsible for telling the story. <cite>Derby Drama</cite> is much simpler,
 and it's intended for one-shots instead of a long series of connected games. And
 <cite>Derby Drama</cite> uses only common six-sided dice, instead of D&D's several differently-sized
 dice.

 If you like D&D, you may (or may not!) like <cite>Derby Drama</cite>! If you hate D&D,
 still consider giving <cite>Derby Drama</cite> a try.

<h3>Q: If <cite>Derby Drama</cite> isn't like <cite>D&D</cite>, what is it like?</h3>

I was inspired by several games while making this, including:
  * Grant Howitt's [Crash Pandas](https://gshowitt.itch.io/crash-pandas)
  * Avery Adler's [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year)
  * Luke Crane's [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/)
  * Sage LaTorra & Adam Koebel's [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/)
  * Lucian Kahn's [Visigoths vs Mall Goths](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/luciankahn/visigoths-vs-mall-goths)
  * John Harper's [Blades in the Dark](https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel)

...buuuuut I don't think <cite>Derby Drama</cite> is much like any of them! I <em>hope</em>
that it's like all the emotions of a derby bout squished into a book and character sheets
and some dice!

<h3>Q: Okay, but seriously, how do you play?</h3>

The full ruleset isn't ready yet, but here's a summary:

Each player choses to play a Jammer or a Blocker. They create a derby name
and look for their character, as well as assigning numbers to four
stats: AGILITY, POWER, DRAMA, and HEART.

Just like a real roller derby bout, <cite>Derby Drama</cite> is broken up
into two periods, each having multiple jams.

During a jam, each team rolls the Team Dice that will determine
the score. Then players decide (secretly) on a specific strategy or
play.  Next, each player reveals
their strategy. A good offensive strategy can allow your own team to
replace low team dice to gain more points. A
good defensive strategy can force the opposing team to replace a high
team die. A failed strategy can lead to a disadvantage -- making scoring
all the more difficult.

When all the players have played out their strategies, the Team Dice
totals are added to the Scoreboard. The team with the highest score
at the end of the bout will win the game-within-the-game.

Between jams and at halftime, players can role-play how they are
feeling about the bout, their teammates, and their rivals. They can try
to gain advantage for their own team by Boosting Morale (with HEART), or
disadvantage the opposing team by Stirring Up DRAMA. Friendship,
romance, revenge, and straight-up cheating are all on the table. However -
schemes can backfire. If your team has Too Much Drama, everything
spirals out of control, and who knows what could happen?

Hopefully this summary gets you excited to see the full rules and
try out the game!
