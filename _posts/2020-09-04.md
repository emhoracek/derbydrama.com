I'm so excited to announce that [Derby Drama version 1.0](https://horrorcheck.itch.io/derby-drama) is OUT now and available for purchase and download on itch.io.

I'm also finishing the first wave of Kickstarter mail-outs tonight. Folks who have already recieved their packages are sharing them on Twitter and Instagram!
