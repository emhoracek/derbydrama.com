title:  "Post-PAX Unplugged rules updates"
---

I attended PAX Unplugged for the first time this past weekend! It was a little overwhelming to be honest, but it was wonderful to run into folks I met at Metatopia earlier this year and also make some new friends and play fun games.

I was privileged to playtest my game in [ManaPot Studios](http://manapotstudios.com)' NYC Indie RPG room with a ton of designers waaaay more experienced than me and it was wonderful. The organizers did an amazing job making sure I had everything I needed and was prepared despite being very overwhelmed and lost that day!

If you've played Derby Drama in the past through one of the Discord playtests or at Metatopia, I made some changes for PAX. I redesigned character sheets to have a clearer table of strategy options and wrote better explanations of strategies and trade-offs. I also added notes on respecting the agency of other players when you're Boosting Morale and Stirring Up Drama - thanks [Lauren McManamon](https://www.thestraykiwi.com/) for suggesting that improvement!

The biggest change is to drama tokens. At Metatopia, [Jeff Stormer](https://www.partyofonepodcast.com/) suggested some sort of exhaustion meter for characters. This gave me ideas for how to make drama tokens feel more important.
  * Play now requires exactly 4 drama tokens per player
  * If you pick up 5 drama tokens you're too tired to do anything but play it "Safe"
  * When all the drama tokens run out, the character with the most tokens cracks and is expelled from the bout!

During the PAX playtest, I decided to incorporate a new drama token rule - you can voluntarily take on drama tokens to get extra dice. This like how in Forged in the Dark games you can "push yourself". I may even steal the terminology from those games and just start calling them stress tokens instead. Somehow, despite never having played BitD, I've accidentally made a FitD game...

I thought these new drama tokens rules were really fun when we tried it out! There was a lot of suspense as we watched the pool of tokens dwindle. Then I took a gamble on an extra die, failed my roll, and had to take the final token! I had the most drama, so my character had a meltdown when she failed her apex jump and started arguing with the ref. It was very dramatic scene and just what I want from this game!
