## General Rolling Procedure

Roll as many dice as you have points in the relevant stat. Count your successes. When you’re working *against* someone a success is a roll of 3 or under. When you’re *helping* someone, a success is a roll of 4 or higher.

Any time you have no successes, your move backfires or fails, your team takes a disadvantage, and you take a stress token.

Each move has a different effect when you succeed.

## Off-track Moves

| Move | Stat | 1 success | 2+ successes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Boost Morale | HEART | Relieve stress | Gain an advantage |
| Stir Up Drama | DRAMA | Give stress | Give a disadvantage |

## On-track Moves

| Move | Stat | 1 success | 2+ successes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offense | POWER or AGILITY | Increase your own team’s score  |
| Defense | POWER or AGILITY | Decrease your opponent’s score |
| Set ‘Em Up | HEART | Give an advantage | Relieve stress |
| Shut ‘Em Down | DRAMA | Give a disadvantage | Give stress |
